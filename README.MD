# Graph Search Algorithms: BFS & Dijkstra

##  Description

This project implements two fundamental graph search algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

The graph is edge-weighted and implemented using a `Vertex` class instead of a traditional `Edge`-based structure. Each `Vertex` contains a map of its adjacent vertices along with the corresponding edge weights.
